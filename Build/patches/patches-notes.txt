Composer Patches
================

# Description

The core may ship composer package versions of third party packages that
are no longer supported by the maintainers. This is done to not break the
backwards compatible promise in the lifetime of TYPO3 core LTS.

When these packages have bugs, they may not be fixed in "upstream" anymore.
In such cases, the core sometimes ships patches to fix details, for instance
when a core LTS version is extended to support new PHP versions, and if some
third party package then raises issues.

These patches may be applied using the `cweagans/composer-patches` composer plugin:
They are applied to the legacy `typo3_src.tgz` downloads during packaging.

The patches are *not* applied to the composer packages, though. Projects can
however copy the `.diff` files, require `cweagans/composer-patches` and
apply the patches if needed.

## List of patches

### [postgres-platform-variable-interpolation-php82-fix.diff](postgres-platform-variable-interpolation-php82-fix.diff)

**Needed**: For PHP8.2 with PostgresSQL dbms backend, if E_DEPRECATION logs are not silenced.

`PostgreSqlPlatform` from doctrine/dbal contains a variable interpolation which
is deprecated since PHP8.2. This is fixed in newer doctrine/dbal versions, but
will not be fixed for the EOL version 2.13.x, which is used for TYPO3 v11.
The composer patch provided to enable PHP8.2 support for TYPO3 v11.

PHP8.2 deprecations are compile time errors of E_DEPRECATE, fail if E_ALL is enabled
or if errors are converted to exceptions. The patch is not needed if deprecations
are suppressed and not logged, or if postgres DBMS platform is not used in a project.

The fix is a simple oneliner avoiding the variable interpolation.
